# Automotive AI Ecosystem

This repository contains the code for the Automotive AI Ecosystem, a comprehensive platform for developing and deploying autonomous driving systems. The ecosystem is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible, allowing researchers and developers to easily experiment with new algorithms and models.

## Architecture

The Automotive AI Ecosystem is based on a layered architecture, with each layer responsible for a specific set of functionalities. The layers are as follows:

*   **Infrastructure Layer:** Provides the underlying hardware and software infrastructure for the ecosystem, including edge computing nodes, cloud computing resources, and a 5G/6G network.
*   **Data Acquisition Layer:** Responsible for collecting data from a variety of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, radar, IMU/GPS, and ultrasonic sensors. It also includes an OBD-II interface for collecting data from the vehicle's internal systems.
*   **Data Fusion Layer:** Fuses data from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's environment.
*   **Advanced AI Architecture:** Contains the core AI algorithms and models for perception, planning, and decision-making.
*   **Intelligent User Interface Layer:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the autonomous driving system.
*   **Security and Cybersecurity Layer:** Ensures the safety and security of the ecosystem.
*   **Metrics and Monitoring Layer:** Monitors the performance of the ecosystem and collects data for analysis.
*   **Deployment and Scalability Layer:** Provides tools and infrastructure for deploying and scaling the ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Automotive AI Ecosystem, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory. The documentation provides detailed instructions on how to set up the development environment, build the code, and run the autonomous driving system.

## GitHub Workflows

This project uses GitHub Workflows to automate the development process. The following workflows are available:

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** This workflow is triggered on every push and pull request. It builds the code, runs tests, and performs static analysis to ensure that the code is of high quality.
*   **Deployment:** This workflow is triggered manually. It deploys the autonomous driving system to a specified environment, such as a development server or a production vehicle.

To use the workflows, you will need to have a GitHub account and be a member of the project. Once you have been added to the project, you can trigger the workflows by pushing code to the repository or by creating a pull request.
